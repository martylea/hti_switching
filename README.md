## Assessing the effects of functional groups on hemithioindigo photoswitches
### Determining how the nature of the substituent, in addition to its position on the switching architecture can lead to changes in how the switches function. We expect that properties including but not limited to thermal reisomerization barriers, absorption spectra and kinetics may all be changed as a result of functionalization.
#### We plan to use ORCA/5.0.1 to carry out the bulk of calculations but may switch code if we require a certain feature of another.

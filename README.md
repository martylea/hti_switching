## Assessing the effects of functional groups on hemithioindigo photoswitches
### Determining how the nature of the substituent, in addition to its position on the switching architecture can lead to changes in how the switches function. We expect that properties including but not limited to thermal reisomerization barriers, absorption spectra and kinetics may all be changed as a result of functionalization.
